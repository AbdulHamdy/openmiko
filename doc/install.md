# Installation

Download the specific version of the firmware you wish to install.
Rename the firmware to `demo.bin` and put it in on the root of the microSD card.


Power off the camera and insert the microSD card.


Hold the setup button, plug in your USB cable, keep holding the setup button for 1-2 seconds until the light is solid blue, then release the button.

After about 30 seconds you should get a flashing yellow LED which indicates the camera is working.
