# Development

Run `docker-compose up -d` to automatically pull down a container with buildroot.

To save time you can download and copy `openmiko-output.tar.gz` to `/openmiko/build/buildroot-2016.02` and untar it. This contains all the build artifacts and can save a considerable amount of time on a slower system. If you want to build everything from scratch simply `cd /openmiko/build/buildroot-2016.02` and run `make`.
